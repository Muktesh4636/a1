# Complete anonymity setup - prevents all tracing methods

echo "🔒 Complete Anonymity Protection Setup"
echo "========================================"
echo ""
echo "This setup prevents tracing through:"
echo "  1. Server IP address"
echo "  2. Domain registration (WHOIS)"
echo "  3. Hosting provider logs"
echo "  4. DNS records"
echo ""
echo "STEP 1: Domain Privacy (CRITICAL)"
echo "  - Enable WHOIS Privacy at registrar"
echo "  - OR transfer domain to Cloudflare (free privacy)"
echo "  - Run: ./scripts/check_domain_privacy.sh"
echo ""
echo "STEP 2: Cloudflare Proxy (CRITICAL)"
echo "  - Sign up: https://www.cloudflare.com"
echo "  - Add domain and enable Proxy (orange cloud)"
echo "  - This hides your real server IP"
echo ""
echo "STEP 3: Enable Cloudflare-Only Mode"
echo "  - Add to .env: ENFORCE_CLOUDFLARE_ONLY=True"
echo "  - This blocks direct IP access"
echo ""
echo "STEP 4: Use Anonymous Payment"
echo "  - Use cryptocurrency for hosting payments"
echo "  - Use prepaid cards"
echo "  - Use privacy-focused payment methods"
echo ""
echo "STEP 5: Anonymous Hosting (Optional)"
echo "  - Use hosting that accepts cryptocurrency"
echo "  - Use hosting in privacy-friendly countries"
echo "  - Use VPS providers that don't require ID"
echo ""
echo "RESULT:"
echo "  ✅ Domain WHOIS: Shows privacy service, not you"
echo "  ✅ Server IP: Hidden behind Cloudflare"
echo "  ✅ Hosting logs: Only show Cloudflare IPs"
echo "  ✅ DNS records: Point to Cloudflare, not your IP"
echo "  ✅ Payment: Anonymous (if using crypto/prepaid)"

echo "⚠️  IMPORTANT: Complete ALL steps for full protection"
